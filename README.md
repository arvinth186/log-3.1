 # Login and Registration System

A basic login and registration system using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- Web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx)
- PHP
- MySQL
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL

## Installation

1. Create a MySQL database and import the SQL schema from `database.sql`.
2. Configure the database connection in `config.php`.
3. Place project files in the web server's document root.
4. Ensure proper file permissions for the server.

## How To Use
1. Database Setup: Ensure that you have a MySQL database with a table named "logs" containing columns for "username," "name," "email," and "password." Update the database configuration in config.php.

2. File Placement: Place all PHP files in your web server's document root folder. Make sure to have proper file permissions.

3. JSON Data File (Optional): The code uses a JSON file (data.json) to demonstrate data storage for user profiles. You can remove this file and update the code to interact directly with the database if desired.

4. Dependencies: The application uses Bootstrap and jQuery, so make sure to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files from their respective CDNs.

5. Access the Application: Open your web browser and access the index.php file . You can register a new account or log in with an existing one.

## Usage

- Access the login and registration forms on `index.php`.
- Create an account and log in.
- Update user profile details on `profile.php`.
- Log out.

## File Structure

- `index.php`: Main login and registration page.
- `profile.php`: User profile page.
- `login.php`: Handles user login.
- `register.php`: Handles user registration.
- `update_profile.php`: Updates user profile details.
- `config.php`: Database connection configuration.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure security for production use (use prepared statements for database queries).
- This is a basic example and not recommended for production without additional security measures.

## Notes

The code uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
It is important to secure the database connection credentials and consider additional security measures, such as HTTPS, when deploying the application to a production environment.
Feel free to modify and extend the code to suit your requirements.
